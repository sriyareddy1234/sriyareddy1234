          Injuries on both the sides,coupled with unavailability of afew foreign
           players,will make the choices restricted for the two teams who have new 
           leaders in the place in the form of Punjab's Shikar Dhawan and Kolkata's Nithin rana.
           These are the two franchises, which over the years have flattered to deceive. 
           Inconsistencies in team selections seemed to have also affected the them badly.
           While PBKS finished sixth, two-time champions KKR ended a rung below in the seventh 
           spot in the 10-team competition last year.

            A distinctive feature of the 'new India' is the relentless demonisation of 
            political opponents, whether at the central or state levels. At the Centre we’ve 
            seen the disqualification from Parliament of Rahul Gandhi, the man Bharatiya Janata 
            Party (BJP) supporters love to hate — for what’s at worst a silly joke of the sort 
            that’s rife in Indian politics.Karnataka chief minister Basavraj Bommai has said Rahul’s 
            punishment shows all are equal before the law. This is far from the case. It’s not just 
            that BJP trains its considerable vituperative firepower routinely on political opponents 
            with no consequences (Rahul himself has been denounced as the "Mir Jafar” of our times).

        </div>
        <div class="time">March 31, 2023</div>
        <div class="content">
            About 20% of the assembly constituencies in poll-bound Karnataka have a substantial presence 
            of Telugus who, according to Telugu associations, will decide the fate of the candidates.
            With the elections set to be held on May 10, all eyes are on BRS, TDP and YSR Congress which 
            will be roped in by their friendly allies in the neighbouring state to woo Telugu people in 
            various constituencies. For all the 224 constituencies, polling will be held on May 10.
            According to the Telugu associations in Karnataka and Bengaluru, nearly one crore population 
            of the total seven crore population in Karnataka are Telugus, who include those who have settled 
            down in the state several decades ago and those who came to Karnataka for employment or for doing 
            business or setting up real estate ventures.
